## Introduction

Food detection is an essential task in computer vision with numerous applications, including restaurant menu analysis, dietary tracking, and food waste reduction. This project aims to build a robust food detection model using the state-of-the-art EfficientNet architecture.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of food images collected from various sources, including food blogs, social media, and recipe websites. The dataset is labeled with various food categories, making it suitable for multi-class food detection.

## Model Architecture

The core of this project is the EfficientNet architecture, a family of neural network models that provide an excellent trade-off between model size and performance. The pre-trained EfficientNet model is fine-tuned on the food detection dataset to adapt to the specific task.

## Usage

To use the trained food detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ombharat6361/Culinary-Cognition.git
   cd Culinary-Cognition
